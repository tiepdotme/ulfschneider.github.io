This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) on a Mac and hosted on [Github](https://github.com). I´m proud it has a service worker on board – so it´s a *[Progressive Web App](/reading/going-offline-video/).* The typeface is [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/). I write [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) with [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) and all code with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). The CSS toolkit is [Compose](/tools/compose/).
