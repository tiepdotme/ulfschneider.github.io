I build and share these tools:

<div class="text-grid">
<h2><a href="{{site.url}}/xg/">Exposure Guide</a></h2>
An iPhone App that allows you to calibrate the darkening effect of your photographic neutral density filters. Exposure Guide has a timer for single und combined filter use.

<h2><a class="title" href="{{site.url}}/memyak/">memYAK</a></h2>
The external memory for innovation teams with special support for agile software development. We use this web application at Wincor Nixdorf to support our agile product development teams in China, Germany, Netherlands and Poland.

<h2><a class="title" href="{{site.url}}/spitfire/">Spitfire</a></h2>
A virtual whiteboard to be shared by multiple persons at the same time. Users will be anonymous - so no one needs to sign in. Go to <a href="http://spitfire.meteor.com">spitfire.meteor.com</a> and start a whiteboard session. 

<h2><a class="title" href="{{site.url}}">{{site.url | remove_first: "http://" }}</a></h2>
This site is build and maintained with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. Source code is on <a href="https://github.com/ulfschneider/ulfschneider.github.io">GitHub</a>. I am using <a href="http://packery.metafizzy.co">Packery</a> for image gallery alignment and <a href="https://github.com/jasonmayes/Twitter-Post-Fetcher">Twitter-Post-Fetcher</a> to access my Twitter timeline.  The font is <em>Input Sans</em> by <a href="http://djr.com">David Jonathan Ross</a>. This font is designed with code in mind. Fonts for coding normally are monospaced, but <em>Input Sans</em> is a proportional font which combines the clarity of monospace with the reading comfort of a proportional font. I´m purchasing it at <a href="http://webtype.com">Webtype</a>, where you can test and play with any of their fonts for 30 days at no cost, until you decide what is right for you. The desktop variant of <em>Input</em> is <a href="http://input.fontbureau.com">free</a> for private use and the web font variant is really inexpensive - lot´s of value for the money.
