title: Renaturation of the Paderborn inner city area
subtitle: During the Corona crisis I am all day at home with Emil. Every now and then we have to breakout for a little excursion. WeÂ´ve come to enjoy the newly re-naturated area in the midst of Paderborn. Emil is jumping from pond to pond and finding secret items. The new design makes this a place to calm down. We appreciate it!
