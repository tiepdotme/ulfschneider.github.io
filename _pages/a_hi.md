<h1 class="fs-3 lh-1 normal mrb-1">Hi, I am <span class="inline-block"><strong>Ulf Schneider</strong>,</span><br> a developer and agile coach living in Paderborn, Germany.</h1>

In 1996 I graduated at the University of Paderborn (Dipl.-Wirt. Inform.). Throughout 25 years in the software industry, I was more than ten years with IBM Global Services as a developer and software architect and more than seven years self-employed as an agile coach and trainer. Since 2014 I am employed as an agile coach at the software organization of Diebold Nixdorf.

I am [riding](/bike/cross-the-alps/) race bikes and the [Bullitt](/emil/2016-10-02/) together with my boy [Emil](/emil/emil-is-ready-for-the-beach/). Emil is very concerned about the Coronavirus pandemic and pictured the [virus](/emil/emil-pictured-the-coronavirus/).
