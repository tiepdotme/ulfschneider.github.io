Hi, my name is Ulf Schneider and I live in Paderborn, Germany.

Here you can find some of my [thoughts]({{site.url}}/thoughts) about agile software development.

In 1996 I graduated from the University of Paderborn (Dipl.-Wirt. Inform.). Over the course of 25 years in the software industry, I was more than 10 years with IBM Global Services as a developer and software architect and more than 7 years self-employed as an agile coach and trainer. Since 2014 I am employed as an agile coach for the software organization of Diebold Nixdorf. I gathered the following certificates:

- IBM: Certified IT Architect
- Scrum Alliance: CSM, CSPO, CSD, CSP
- Sun: SCJP, SCWCD, SCBCD
- Lotus: Principal Application Developer, Principal System Administrator

I am [riding race bikes]({{site.url}}/after-ride-party) and the [Bullitt]({{site.url}}/2016-10-02/) together with my boy [Emil]({{site.url}}/2016-09-25-2/). Every now and then IÂ´m taking [photographs]({{site.url}}/photography).
