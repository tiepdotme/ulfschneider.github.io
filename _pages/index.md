my name is Ulf Schneider. I am an Agile coach and a software developer. I am employed at [Wincor Nixdorf](http://www.wincor-nixdorf.com), supporting the world wide transition of the R&D software department to be able to <em>produce a continuous stream of done software in each iteration, always delivering the most important parts first.

Here you can find some of my [writing](/know-how) about Agile software development. 

Over the course of 20 years in the software industry I was more than 10 years with [IBM Global Services](http://www.ibm.com) as a developer and architect and more than 7 years self employed as an Agile coach and trainer - mainly leveraging the [Scrum](http://www.scrumguides.org) framework.

In 1996 I graduated from the University of Paderborn (Dipl.-Wirt. Inform.) and since then gathered the following certificates:

* Scrum Alliance: CSM, CSPO, CSD, CSP
* Sun: SCJP, SCWCD, SCBCD
* Lotus: Principal Application Developer, Principal System Administrator
* IBM: Certified IT Architect
