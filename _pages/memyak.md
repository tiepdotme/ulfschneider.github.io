You can store any kind of data in memYAK and use filter and search mechanisms to select the contents that are of relevance for you. Structured navigational concepts like a Kanban Grid or a Product Backlog View support you in your project work. A Product Burndown Diagram indicates the progress of your endeavors.

memYAK is a Java Enterprise application that leverages [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) for data storage. Install memYAK in a web container like Tomcat. Fire up your web browser and you are ready to start.
