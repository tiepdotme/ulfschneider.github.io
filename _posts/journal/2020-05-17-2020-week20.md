- I learned about [preloading web fonts](/journal/preloading-web-fonts/). 
- I wrote an [adoption of the FitVids script](/journal/fluid-videos-with-my-adaption-of-fitvids/), which I´m using to have fluid videos on my website .
- It´s decided, I´m migrating my Jekyll website to 11ty. While in the midst of the process, I found 11ty is giving me more control in handling the creation of the search-index. Also, code prettifying, where 11ty is relying on [Prism](https://prismjs.com) during build-time, was quick and nice to setup.
- I discovered Stephany Eckles´ impressive site of [modern CSS solutions](https://moderncss.dev). It´s state-of-the-art with much love for the details.
- Josh Branchaud is journaling his [daily learnings](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) straight forward on GitHub. Simple design and deep content!
