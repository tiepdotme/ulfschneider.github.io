abstract: Making architectural decisions in a cooperative way at a point in time when they are needed - and not earlier, is a quality-improving paradigm in agile software development. My thesis is, that conceptual integrity will only be achieved for the software if one person has the final word regarding those decisions. This is the architect, who fulfills a task for the delivery team and whose rights and duties in context of the Scrum process are being reflected in this article.

This text was first published in OBJEKTspektrum, issue 4/2011, under the title [„Scrum und Architektur, konzeptionelle Integrität im Scrum Prozess“][schneider2011]. I have enhanced and translated the initial document to publish it here.

Making architectural decisions in a cooperative way at a point in time when they are needed - and not earlier, is a quality-improving paradigm in agile software development. My thesis is, that conceptual integrity will only be achieved for the software if one person has the final word regarding those decisions. This is the architect, who fulfills a task for the delivery team and whose rights and duties in context of the Scrum process are being reflected in this article.

Iterations
---
Scrum is team-oriented and separates the delivery process into subsequent iterations, so called sprints. The question rises how  a conceptual integer architecture, an architecture that is intuitively understandable for users, developers and operators even after many iterations, can be achieved while the team is focusing on the microcosmos and solution patterns of current iterations. 

To achieve conceptual integrity it has to be considered during the entire design and delivery process of a software solution. I will make organizational and manual suggestions with the purpose to support this in the Scrum process. I will emphasize the role of the architect as an important player with strong responsibilities for the conceptual integrity of the software product.
