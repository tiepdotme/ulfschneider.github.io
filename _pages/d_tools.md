This site is build and maintained with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). [Source code](https://github.com/ulfschneider/ulfschneider.github.io) is on GitHub. I am using [Twitter-Post-Fetcher](https://github.com/jasonmayes/Twitter-Post-Fetcher) to access my Twitter timeline and [Unveil.js](http://luis-almeida.github.io/unveil/) to delay the loading of images in galleries until they are needed. The typeface is [Input](http://djr.com) by David Jonathan Ross. I´m purchasing it at [Webtype](http://webtype.com), where you can test and play with any of their fonts for 30 days at no cost, until you decide what is right for you. The desktop variant of *Input* is [free](http://input.fontbureau.com) for private use and the web typeface variant is really inexpensive - lot´s of value for the money.

I build and share these tools:
