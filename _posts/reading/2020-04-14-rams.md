[Rams](https://hustwit.vhx.tv/products/rams) is a documentary by filmmaker Gary Hustwit about the legendary designer Dieter Rams. For decades, Dieter Rams was leading the design department of Braun, where he was responsible for iconic product designs which can now be found in the [MoMa](https://www.moma.org/artists/8451). 

The film is a masterpiece. A calm and beautiful presentation with a private, 85 years old Dieter Rams. The film also features an original score by pioneering musician Brian Eno.

I came across it because Hustwit is making this [film available for free](https://www.ohyouprettythings.com/free) from April 7 to 14 due to the COVID-19 crisis. Thank you Gary, and Dieter! Clearly, a ★.
