- A set of free [Coronavirus awareness icons](https://www.iconfinder.com/p/coronavirus-awareness-icons) from iconfinder.
- Another great page: [Paul liebt Paula](https://paulliebtpaula.de/ueber-uns/). I found it on my chase for Lightroom presets, because during this week I discovered that unfortunately [VSCO](https://vsco.co) is not in the Lightroom Preset Business anymore.
- Alternatives for VSCO: [RNI](https://reallyniceimages.com), [Paul liebt Paula](https://paulliebtpaula.de/presets/).
