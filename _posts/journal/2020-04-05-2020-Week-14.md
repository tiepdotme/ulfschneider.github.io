- Max Böck published a boilerplate [Emergency Website Kit](https://mxb.dev/blog/emergency-website-kit/), which, especially these days, aims to provide a quick way to publish critical information with a single HTTP request. The technique has the ability to handle sudden load spike with maximum resilience.
- The Complete [An Event Apart Washington DC 2019 Sessions](https://aneventapart.com/news/post/the-complete-aea-dc-2019-now-online) are available online. That´s quite something to study.
- I´ve learned that there is a <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> tag in HTML which <s>can</s>should be used for dates and time to improve semantic HTML.
- A compelling talk from Aaron Gustafson: [Progressive Web Apps: Where Do I Begin?](https://aneventapart.com/news/post/progressive-web-apps-where-do-i-begin-aea-video). It´s not mainly about the service worker. Aaron is pointing out that a Progressive Web App aims to enhance *– progress –* an already great experience of a web site with performance, less network reliance, offline capabilities, and engagement. It´s a chain of: focusing on what matters most for a particular web page to create a great core experience (again, [start with words](https://justinjackson.ca/words.html)); writing semantic markup to support the core experience; designing to support the core experience; and finally using JavaScript to support the core experience.
- I have added a search function to my static [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)-driven site. It´s a client side search powered by [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com). Currently the search index for the entire web site is built with the first query a user kicks off. This is clearly something to be improved for the future. But still I´m happy with that thing for now.
