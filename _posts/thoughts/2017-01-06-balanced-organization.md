abstract: The agile manifesto defines a collobaration culture. But what if your current environment is not collaborative? This article describes alternatives to go ahead into the agile direction.

For those of us being part of the agile movement, many consider a collaboration culture as a worthwile goal for any organization and even further assume this goal is shared by the members of those organizations. 

This assumption is false. For an organization lacking the heritage of a collaboration culture, turning towards agile will bring only limited results without understanding what is going on behind the scenes. 

In general, William Schneider admits the possibility of a culture transformation, but he is also pointing out the difficulty, the risk and the long-term nature (more than 10 years) of such an endeavor [Schneider 2000]. Schneider believes that at least 75% of the management needs to be convinced about it. For this kind of conviction John Kotter coined the phrase *sense of urgency,* [Kotter 1996]. Such conditions are seldom to be found.

If your current organization is not rooted in a collaborative way of thinking and acting, than the organization will only endure agility, but not support or emphasize it. Still, agile projects achieve positive outcomes, but only while getting the low hanging fruits during project runtime. Afterwards many of the introduced behavioral changes diminish and daily work is snapping back to how things have always been done around here. As soon as the agile coach is leaving, agile patterns collapse and disappear. 

In highly competitive and innovative markets there are real advantages in being agile. Here agile helps to get feedback fast, to learn, to decide, to produce results early, to connect with customers and increase employee satsifaction. In an environment where more is unknown than known, where the explorer mindset is key, the driving forces of agile help to survive. 

When a culture transformation towards collaboration is too time consumptive (of course) and ever pushing with the help of an agile coach without sustainable outcome isn´t satisfying (of course), what is a pragmatic way to get some positive results? 

William Schneider´s Core Culture Model will allow us to identify our organizations current culture and classify it into one of four categories. This can be used as a starting point - understand where we are and slightly balance towards a new direction. Any change has grow from the inside of the organization and has to rely on the strengths of the current culture. Imitating or copying the culture of another organization will not be sustainable. Also keep in mind, that organizational change takes time and will never end, it is a continuous game. In other words, the organization has to adapt or die.

Of course, there are more than four organizational cultures and in reality probably no organization is identical with another, but with the Core Culture Model we can reduce reality to some important characterestics which play a role in this context.

Schneider differentiates the following four core cultures:

* Control Culture
* Collaboration Culture
* Competence Culture
* Cultivation Culture

Any of these cultures has specific ways to handle authority, power, leadership, decision making, performance measurement and relations with partners and customers. To understand what that means, we go more into detail for each of the core cultures.


Control Culture
---

The prototype of this culture is the military. The leadership style is dominant. The more the actions of other people can be influenced and controlled, the better. The more subordinates, the better. Markets are being taken by acquiring, not through innovation.

The system is more important than people. Any person is "... like a hand in a bucket of water - when the hand is removed, the water closes in and there is no trace." [Schneider 2000:31]

The position inside of the hierarchy gives authority. Decisions are being taken impersonal. Information goes top down and bottom up inside of the hierarchy and less horizontal. Managers will be told what they want to hear from their subordinates. Information hiding is part of this culture. Conflicts are not seen as being healthy and are usually suppressed. Large control cultures tend to be bureaucratic. 

What is now is valued higher than what might be. Predictability counts.

Employees can spend their entire career in one function. People relationships within the same function are close but relationships between functions tend to be distant and formal. Key decisions are being taken by people at the top and if at all, only top management has an integrating effect. Employee performance is measured. Rendered performance is being rewarded, failure to perform will be sanctioned. Individual growth is limited to functional expertise.

Innovation rate is low but operational performance can be very good. Usually customers and partners are being ignored, they have to adopt themselves to the system. Ideas for change will be quickly rejected. There is not much room for having fun at work. 

The control culture is the most widespread organisation culture of the last century.

In one sentence: The system is most important and big size counts.

Collaboration Culture
---

The prototype of the collaboration culture is the family. In competitive situations it´s about our team against their team. Synergy is key and 2 plus 2 sums up to 5 when people are working together and support each other towards a shared goal. Positive and mutual emphasizing relationships propel the team. People feel connected and obliged to their organization - and vice versa. Attitude is, together we win and alone we lose. There is not much distance between top management and work force. If the organization has commercial success, all people participate in the financial wealth. The collobaration culture is more egalitarian than other cultures.

Like an orchestra, all individuals try to behave at their best for the optimal overarching result. Excessive egoism or diva-attitude will not be tolerated.

Releationships to customers are partner-oriented. Customers are part of the team and much energy is invested to understand the customers and supply to their real demands and needs. 

Ideas and concepts are important but it is people who are nurtured. Loyalty and trust are essential while politics, infighting and betrayal erode collaboration.

Whatever works is emphasized, particularly what the team decides will work. Pragmatism is part of daily life and initiative of individuals and teams is high. The collaboration culture sees the need for quick change and reacts accordingly. The culture is more tactical than strategic.

Leaders put a huge fraction of their time and energy into team building with a focus on integration. They value different talents and are willing to make personal sacrifices for the good of the larger organization. Communication is with the entire team. Only leaders who contribute and really make things happen have authority. The authority is rooted in the relationship power and less in role power. Leaders are firsts among equals.

Judgements and decision making are participative and collegial. Informations and people find their way easily to the place where needed. Conflicts are seen to be constructive as they increase the performance of the team.

Collaboration cultures can be found in interdisciplanary work environments where speed and complexity come together.

In one sentence: We are great and the team comes first.


Competence Culture
---
The prototype of the competence culture is the university. Important are expertise and advancement of knowledge. The motives are excellence, mastery and achievement of goals. One has to be better than others, to *compete*. Authority inside the organization can only be gained through expertise.

Competence cultures supply their customers with the best product at a high price.

Concepts, ideas and theories are important and people have to follow. Relationships are on the impersonal side and are defined by the task which has to be achieved. Communication style is non-formal, unemotional and facts based. The organization ensures a lot of individual freedom as people ask for autonomy and the opportunity for individual achievement. People like to be measured and challenged, to prove they are at the top of their craft. 

While in the control culture operational systematics are put into focus, the competence culture is giving interest to conceptual systematics. Other than in the control culture will bad quality not be tolerated in the competence culture. Members of competence cultures hate it to deliver poor quality. Usually members of competence culture feel more connected to their profession than to their organization.

The competence culture is a meritocracy. One has to prove and demonstrate competence. You won´t get away with lip service. Behavior is disciplined and goal oriented. Things will be done right and good. The search for improvements is neverending and challenges are welcomed.

The competence culture is future oriented. Strategic considerations are taken seriosly and derived actions will be performed with consequence. Nevertheless, new chances will not be overlooked.

Leaders are never fully satisfied. They are goal minded and willing to take any decision necessery to achieve those goals. Employees are not necessary bound to a function but move quickly to where their expertise is most suitable for the achievement of a goal. Usually conflicts are handled logical with reasoning.

Competence cultures can be found in innovative markets and niche markets. But the niche can be tall and possibly being dominated by only one organization. In any case the produced goods or services are exceptional.

In one sentence: We are exceptional and we can prove it.


Cultivation Culture
---
The prototype of the collaboration culture is the religious community. Personal development, to explore personal potentials is the central motive. Values give orientation. There are not many explicit rules, but ethical behavior is important. The functioning of the organization is ensured through mutual commitments to shared values. A member who is not trustworthy or not dedicated to the goals of the organization will have to leave. On the otherhand, if someone is recognized as being trustworthy but has a bad performance a second chance will sure be given. Possibly in another, better suited function with better conditions to grow.
