The [book](https://abookapart.com/products/going-offline) is following the same agenda as Jeremy does in his [talk](/reading/going-offline-video/). Of course, the book provides more background and details. It also contains a list of valuable resource links. Having watched the video of the talk before, I think it is an excellent next step on my quest to understand the groundwork of Progressive Web Apps.
