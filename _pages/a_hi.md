Hi, my name is Ulf Schneider and I live in Paderborn, Germany. I write here about [agile software development]({{site.url}}/thoughts).

In 1996 I graduated from the University of Paderborn (Dipl.-Wirt. Inform.). Throughout 25 years in the software industry, I was more than ten years with IBM Global Services as a developer and software architect and more than seven years self-employed as an agile coach and trainer. Since 2014 I am employed as an agile coach for the software organization of Diebold Nixdorf. I gathered the following certificates:

-   IBM: Certified IT Architect
-   Scrum Alliance: CSM, CSPO, CSD, CSP
-   Sun: SCJP, SCWCD, SCBCD
-   Lotus: Principal Application Developer, Principal System Administrator

I am riding race bikes and the [Bullitt]({{site.url}}/2016-10-02/) together with my boy [Emil]({{site.url}}/2016-09-25-2/). Contact me via +49 163 2505164.
