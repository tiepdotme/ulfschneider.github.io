The blog is using the font [Input Sans](http://input.fontbureau.com). This font is not for free. IÂ´ve purchased it at [Webtype](http://webtype.com) and included a CSS provided by them into _includes/head.html.
You have to remove this CSS and purchase the font on your own or simply use a different font.

Feel free to use all other HTML and CSS as you please. If you do use them, a link back to https://github.com/ulfschneider/ulfschneider.github.io would be appreciated, but is not required.
