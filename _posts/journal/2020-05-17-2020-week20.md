- I learned about [preloading web fonts](/journal/preloading-web-fonts/). 
- To have fluid videos on by website I created an [adoption of the FitVids script](/journal/fluid-videos-with-my-adaption-of-fitvids/).
- It´s decided, I´m migrating my Jekyll website to 11ty. While in the midst of the process, I found 11ty is giving me more control in handling the creation of the search-index. Also code prettifying, which is based on [prism](https://prismjs.com) for 11ty and is done during build-time, was quick and nice to setup.
- I found Stephany Eckles´ impressive site of [modern CSS solutions](https://moderncss.dev). It´s state-of-the art with much love for the details.
- Josh Branchaud is journaling his [daily learnings](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) straight forward on GitHub. Simple design and deep content!
