- Learned about [scroll-margin-top](https://css-tricks.com/fixed-headers-and-jump-links-the-solution-is-scroll-margin-top/) from CSS Tricks.
- Found two designers whose work really resonates with me. There is a lot to learn from [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com) and [Mark Boulton](http://markboulton.co.uk/).
- Published [Compose CSS v1.0.0](/compose).
- Interesting: [The Evolution of Web Design](https://fabianburghardt.de/webolution/).
- Have to evaluate [accessible colors](https://accessible-colors.com) for anything with colors.
- Installed [ColorSlurp](http://colorslurp.com) color picker and like the tool.
- Read about how Jonnie Hallmann redesigned his website [destroytoday](https://destroytoday.com). He describes in his [Blog](https://destroytoday.com/blog) that he used Nuxt and Contentful. That´s an interesting choice because I like Vue and couldn´t become a friend of React so far. I´m carrying the idea of running my blog as a PWA for some time now – just to learn it. Therefore I will definitely borrow some ideas from Jonnie.
