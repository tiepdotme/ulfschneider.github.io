Self-organization is the determining element for agile teams and companies. To think and act accordingly requires to accept evolutionary forces which are an inherent part of any social system, whether we like it or not. 

This contrasts with the constructing model, in which a central instance designs the system and controls it. Broadly, we can say that self-organization relies on evolution and construction relies on command and obedience.

To affirm the evolutionary approach is rewarding, but will challenge traditional behavioral patterns even in the microcosm of a single team. For the entire - maybe huge - organization is the paradoxon of giving up central control in order to make the organization controllable, radical and requires open minds and the will to learn and to improve - in particular from the leaders of the organization.

Leaders in agile organizations have the important function of actively giving self-organization forces a direction. This seems to be conflicting with the evolutionary approach and to span the tension field even further, IÂ´d like to insert two quotes that I have found in [Malik 2009:137]:

> The only things that evolve by themselves in an organization are disorder, friction, and malperformance. Peter F. Drucker

> ... the only possibility of transcending the capacity of individual minds is to rely on those super personal, self-organizing forces which create spontaneous orders. Friedrich A. von Hayek

Past and present

Fredmund Malik is pointing out in his work, that our current organized society developed itself during 150 years. In former times there were organizations, too, but they had more of an amplifying function which means that most of the people did more or less the same, e.g. shooting a weapon, transport bricks, pile one brick on the other. In these organizations there were only some rare specialists like master builders or officers. In consequence the visibility of tasks and clear hierarchies the communication patterns were simple. Knowledge did not play a major role and only some commands were needed to move the entire organization: "fire", "heave ho" and the like. [Malik 2009:8]

With the dawning industrialization a new type of organization arises. Reading and writing are essential skills even for simplest operations. Specialists are everywhere and not many people are doing the exact same things. Nearly everyone is speaking a specialized language. Knowledge and communication are essential and characteristic for this new organization. The world we live in, with engineers, computer scientists, psychologists, neurologists, marketing experts, genetic engineers and the like developed itself during the last 150 years.

To bridge this organized world over to evolution: The new world is the result of humans acting, but it is not the made by a central constructing instance and in this way not the result of human design [Hayer 1969:33,35], because 150 years ago as well as today no one is able to overview this world, to construct it and to plan it. The system organized itself in evolutionary steps.

Complexity

A consequence of evolution is the increase of complexity. Complexity again is coupled with regulatory capacity. Higher complexity leads to higher regulatory capacity but also increases chances of misregulation. That makes the control of complex system incredibly difficult. But on the other hand, complexity is a prerequisite for outstanding achievements. [Malik 2009:17]

Complex systems function although no one is understanding the entire system. A car manufacturer is able to build a complicated and efficient product in serial production with high safety standards, although no one is understanding fully the entire construction or manufacturing process. A hospital is functioning although no single person knows all processes and all treatment procedures. 

The central construction of such systems would be limited to centralized knowledge which immediatly would become a bottleneck for the organization. It is irritating that a complex system can not be controlled by a central instance, instead the system is self-sustaining. Now self-organization comes into play.

Self-organization

Self-organization describes spontaneous - emergent - processes that are responsible to bring a system into some kind of order and sustaining that order. That includes the reaction to internal and external modifications, in other words the adaptability to new conditions [Bendel 2006:2]. The ability to self-organize is a property of the system even without the actors being aware of that ability. The essential feature of the self-organizing capability is given by the interactions between the actors.
