To support my craft I build and share these tools:

[memYAK]({{site.url}}/memyak) | is the external memory for innovation teams with special support of agile software development. This web application is in use at Wincor Nixdorf to support the agile teams in China, Germany, Netherlands and Poland.
[Xg]({{site.url}}/xg) | is an iPhone App that allows you to calibrate the darkening effect of your photographic neutral density filters. Xg has a timer for single und combined filter use.
[{{site.url | remove_first: "http://" }}](/) | is build and maintained with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I am using [FastClick](http://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick), [Packery](http://pakcery.metafizzy.co) and [TwitterFetcher](https://github.com/jasonmayes/Twitter-Post-Fetcher).
