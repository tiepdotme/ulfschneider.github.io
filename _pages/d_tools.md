I build and share this stuff:

<ul class="post-grid">
	<li class="post-grid">
		<p>
			<a class="title" href="{{site.url}}/xg/">Exposure Guide</a> An iPhone App that allows you to calibrate the darkening effect of your photographic neutral density filters. Exposure Guide has a timer for single und combined filter use.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li class="post-grid">
		<p>
			<a class="title" href="{{site.url}}">{{site.url | remove_first: "http://" }}</a> This site is build and maintained with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. I am using <a href="http://packery.metafizzy.co">Packery</a> for image gallery alignment and <a href="https://github.com/jasonmayes/Twitter-Post-Fetcher">Twitter-Post-Fetcher</a> to access my Twitter timeline. A little bit of <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery</a> is also in. The font is Input Sans by <a href="http://djr.com">David Jonathan Ross</a>. This font is designed with code in mind. Fonts for coding normally are monospaced, but Input Sans is a proportional font which combines the clarity of monospace with the reading comfort of a proportional font.
