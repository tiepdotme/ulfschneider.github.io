As [Gary Hustwit](https://www.hustwit.com) is currently giving his films for free, I watched his [Helvetica Bonus Footage](https://www.ohyouprettythings.com/free) this week. You´re getting to see some very interesting personalities out of the typesetting world. 

*The sad truth in documentary filmmaking is that we shoot far more footage than we can actually use in the final film, and sometimes what ends up on the cutting room floor is fantastic but just doesn’t fit the film’s narrative arc.* 

*Here’s 95 minutes of bonus footage from [Helvetica](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/helvetica3) (actually longer than the movie itself) from Massimo Vignelli, Paula Scher, Stefan Sagmeister, Hermann Zapf, Wim Crouwel, Experimental Jetset, Michael C. Place, David Carson, and many more.*
