Hi,

my name is Ulf Schneider and I live in Paderborn, Germany.

I am an agile coach and a software developer. Together with my colleagues at [Wincor Nixdorf](http://www.wincor-nixdorf.com) I am working towards the transition of our software business unit to deliver a continuous stream of done software in each iteration, always doing the most valuable parts first.

Here you can find some of my [thoughts]({{site.url}}/thoughts) about agile software development.

Over the course of 20 years in the software industry I was more than 10 years with [IBM Global Services](http://www.ibm.com) as a developer and software architect and more than 7 years self employed as an agile coach and trainer - mainly leveraging the [Scrum](http://www.scrumguides.org) framework.

In 1996 I graduated from the University of Paderborn (Dipl.-Wirt. Inform.) and since then gathered the following certificates:

* Scrum Alliance: CSM, CSPO, CSD, CSP
* Sun: SCJP, SCWCD, SCBCD
* Lotus: Principal Application Developer, Principal System Administrator
* IBM: Certified IT Architect

Besides this, every now and then IÂ´m taking [photographs]({{site.url}}/photography).
