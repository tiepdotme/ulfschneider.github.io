[Rams](https://hustwit.vhx.tv/products/rams) is a documentary by filmmaker Gary Hustwit about the legendary designer Dieter Rams. For decades, Dieter Rams was leading the design department of Braun, where he was responsible for iconic product designs which you can find now in the [MoMa](https://www.moma.org/artists/8451). 

The film is a masterpiece. A calm and beautiful presentation with a private, 87 years old collaborative Dieter Rams. The film also features an original score by pioneering musician Brian Eno.

I came across it because Hustwit is making his [films available for free](https://www.ohyouprettythings.com/free) during the COVID-19 crisis. Thank you Gary, and Dieter! Clearly, a ★.
