- This guy [Jack McDade](https://jackmcdade.com/) knows how to design a web page. Jack made [Justin Jackson´s page](https://justinjackson.ca), which I think is an exceptional piece of work. Wow. Jack is also working on a [radical design course](https://radicaldesigncourse.com). What could be the name of the style – *delicate brutalism?*
- Reading Jonathan Snook´s take on a [magazine grid](https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/playing-with-css-grid). Jonathan is pointing out himself that popping out random articles in bigger size might irritate users and I have the same concern. I think all sizes and layout should have a meaning. 
- Keir Watson is describing his process to produce a magazine grid with similar properties in incredible detail on [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/responsive-grid-magazine-layout-in-just-20-lines-of-css/). In fact his CSS grid code does a lot of things in an excellent way while it is only 20 lines long. His explanation however, is multi-page long.
