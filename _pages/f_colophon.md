This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) on a Mac and hosted on [Github](https://github.com). Typeface is [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) in the serif variant for text *â€“ with expressive italics.* IBM Plex Mono is used for code. Headings and meta text are set with [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/). I write [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) with [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) and all code with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). The CSS toolkit is [Compose](https://ulf.codes/compose).
