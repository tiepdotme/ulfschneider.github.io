My personal blog, to be found at [ulf.codes](http://ulf.codes). Built and maintained by using Jekyll for site generation. Hosted on GitHub Pages.

The blog is using a font called 'Input Sans'. This font is not for free. IÂ´ve purchased it at Webtype and included a css provided by them into _includes/head.html.
You have to remove this css and purchase the font on your own or simply use a different font.

Feel free to use the HTML and CSS as you please. If you do use them, a link back to https://github.com/ulfschneider/ulfschneider.github.io would be appreciated, but is not required.
