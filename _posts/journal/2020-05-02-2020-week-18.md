- This week I pushed my little website a step further by enhancing the service worker to pre-cache selected pages and by runtime-caching images as well as all visited pages.
	This improves speed for image rendering drastically and allows to access the cached pages even offline. Voilà.
- I´m using the media-query [any-pointer: coarse](https://medium.com/@ferie/detect-a-touch-device-with-only-css-9f8e30fa1134) to increase line-height of navigation items on touch devices!
- Geoff Graham´s "[There’s an input attribute for a one-time code](https://geoffgraham.me/theres-an-input-attribute-for-a-one-time-code/)" pointed towards the HTML <code>&lt;input type="number" autocomplete="one-time-code" /></code>, which helps to move a two factor authentication code easily into the input field. While researching the topic, I found the <code>autocomplete</code> tag can have [plenty of values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete)! Also, I found "[HTML attributes to improve your users' two factor authentication experience](https://www.twilio.com/blog/html-attributes-two-factor-authentication-autocomplete)" by Phil Nash beneficial. There is an in-depth [CSS-Tricks article by Alex Holachek](https://css-tricks.com/better-form-inputs-for-better-mobile-user-experiences/), as well as a  [simulator made by Alex](https://better-mobile-inputs.netlify.app).
