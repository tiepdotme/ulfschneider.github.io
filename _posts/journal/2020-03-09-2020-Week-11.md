- This guy [Jack McDade](https://jackmcdade.com/) knows how to design a web page. Jack made [Justin Jackson´s page](https://justinjackson.ca), which I think is an exceptional piece of work. Wow. Jack is also working on a [radical design course](https://radicaldesigncourse.com). What could be the name of the style – *delicate brutalism?*
- Reading Jonathan Snook´s take on a [magazine grid](https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/playing-with-css-grid). Jonathan is pointing out himself that popping out random articles in bigger size might irritate users and I have the same concern. I think all sizes and layout should have a meaning.
