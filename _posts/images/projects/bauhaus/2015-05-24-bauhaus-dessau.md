The Bauhaus Dessau is a great place to experience the open-mindedness, the idealistic, adventuresome new thinking and the architectural style that influenced almost every architect and designer in the last 90 years. An icon of the modern era.

When you look at the Bauhaus building from 1925/26, it appears like a bunch of boxes spread around but connected to each other.

Glass, transparency and straight lines play a huge role.

The Prellerhaus nowadays is the overnight accomodation of the Bauhaus and the café in the basement of the Bauhaus building serves breakfast, meals and drinks. We stayed there for one night.

A short walk of 2 kilometers will bring you from the Bauhaus building to the Kornhaus. We have been there for dinner and it was quite good.
