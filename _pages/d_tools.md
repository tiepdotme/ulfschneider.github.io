I build and share this stuff:

[Exposure Guide]({{site.url}}/xg) | is an iPhone App that allows you to calibrate the darkening effect of your photographic neutral density filters. Exposure Guide has a timer for single und combined filter use.
[{{site.url | remove_first: "http://" }}](/) | is build and maintained with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I am using [Packery](http://packery.metafizzy.co) for image gallery alignment and [TwitterFetcher](https://github.com/jasonmayes/Twitter-Post-Fetcher) to access my Twitter timeline. A little bit of [jQuery](https://jquery.com) is also in.
