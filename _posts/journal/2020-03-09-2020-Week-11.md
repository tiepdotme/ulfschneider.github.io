- This guy [Jack McDade](https://jackmcdade.com/) knows how to design a web page. Jack made [Justin Jackson´s page](https://justinjackson.ca), which I think is an exceptional piece of work. Wow. Jack is also working on a [radical design course](https://radicaldesigncourse.com). What could be the name of the style – *delicate brutalism?*
- Reading Jonathan Snook´s take on a [magazine grid](https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/playing-with-css-grid). Jonathan is pointing out himself that popping out random articles in bigger size might irritate users and I have the same concern. I think all sizes and layout should have a meaning. 
- Keir Watson is describing his process to produce a [magazine grid](https://css-tricks.com/responsive-grid-magazine-layout-in-just-20-lines-of-css/) with similar properties in incredible detail on CSS Tricks. In fact his CSS grid code does a lot of things in an excellent way while it is only 20 lines long. His explanation however, is multi-page long. 
- Andy Bell describes a technique to [break out of the mould of your fixed-width container to create visual interest](https://piccalil.li/tutorial/creating-a-full-bleed-css-utility/).
- [11ty](https://11ty.dev), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and probably [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox) could be a combination to be used for a nice blog rebuild project, which would eventually turn into a PWA. People seem to be satisfied with 11ty+Netlify.
- Because of the Coronavirus it turns out that many people are staying away from the office now, working from home. Not travelling anymore. Change is happending in behavior and perception. We literally realize that our way of living is not for granted. I´m getting reminded to the book "Blindness" from Jose Saramago, where a city is hit by an epidemic "white blindness". A book I enjoyed reading. Reading "The Plague" from Albert Camus again – I think I´ve read it 35 years ago – could also be a thing.
