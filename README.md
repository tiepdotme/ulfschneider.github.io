My personal site, to be found at [ulf.codes](http://ulf.codes). Built and maintained by using Jekyll for site generation. Hosted on GitHub Pages.

The following directories and their contents are Copyright Ulf Schneider. You may not reuse anything therein without my permission:

* `/_posts`
* `/i`

The blog is using the font [Input Sans](http://input.fontbureau.com). This font is not for free. IÂ´ve purchased it at [Webtype](http://webtype.com) and included a CSS provided by them into `_includes/head.html`.
You have to remove this CSS and purchase the font on your own or simply use a different font. In any case you need to remove the link to `//cloud.webtype.com` from the file `/_includes/head.html`. You have to add your own link to Webtype or use an entirely different font. Additional adjustments need to be taken in `/css/main.css`, here you find some variable settings for the font, font-sizes and line-heights.

The favicon is referred to from the file '/_includes/head.html`. 

Some configurations, like site title for example, can be made in `/_config.yml`.

Feel free to use all other HTML and CSS as you please. If you do use them, a link back to https://github.com/ulfschneider/ulfschneider.github.io would be appreciated, but is not required.
